In this follow-up post to
[How to add JWT Authentication to a CakePHP 3 REST API](/2015/04/how-to-add-jwt-authentication-to-a-cakephp-3-rest-api/)
we will update our existing API so it will produce 
[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) compliant output giving you the
benefits of standardization and instant compatibility with JSON API supporting tools 
like [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data#a-brief-note-on-adapters).

[> API methods used in this post shared with Postman](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/197398a609a6d233a8c2)

Before starting this tutorial either:

+ complete the previous tutorial
+ start fresh by using these
[end-state application sources](https://github.com/bravo-kernel/application-examples/tree/master/blog-how-to-make-your-cakephp-3-api-produce-jsonapi),
composer installing and running the database migration

## 1. Install required packages

To make sure your API is using an up-to-date version of CakePHP and the 
required version of the Crud plugin now update your project's
composer packages by running:

```bash
composer update
```

Update Crud to at least version 5.0.0:

```bash
composer require friendsofcake/crud:^5.0
```

Remove any previous version of the neomerx package:

```bash
composer remove neomerx/json-api
```

Lastly, add the 
[Crud JsonApi listener](https://github.com/FriendsOfCake/crud-json-api)
to your application by running:

```bash
composer require friendsofcake/crud-json-api
```

## 2. Disable JWT authentication

Since JWT authentication is unrelated to JSON API we will disable it by 
removing the related lines in `src/Controller/Api/AppController`
which should leave you with a file looking like this:

```php
<?php
namespace App\Controller\Api;

use Cake\Controller\Controller;
use Cake\Event\Event;

/**
 * AppController specific to API resources
 */
class AppController extends Controller
{

    use \Crud\Controller\ControllerTrait;

    public function initialize()
    {
        parent::initialize();

        $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');
        $this->loadComponent('Crud.Crud', [
            'actions' => [
                'Crud.Index',
                'Crud.View',
                'Crud.Add',
                'Crud.Edit',
                'Crud.Delete'
            ],
            'listeners' => [
                'Crud.Api',
                'Crud.ApiPagination',
                'Crud.ApiQueryLog'
            ]
        ]);
    }
}
```

> Even though the CakePHP and Crud upgrades were **totally
> transparent** while writing this post this might be a good
> moment to verify that your API's `cocktails` endpoint is
> still producing the expected results using GET, POST, etc.

## 3. Enable JSON API

All that is needed now to make your API produce JSON API is opening
`src/Controller/Api/AppController` and replacing the `Crud.Api`
listener with `Crud.JsonAPi` so it looks like:

```php
            'listeners' => [
                'CrudJsonApi.JsonApi',
                'CrudJsonApi.Pagination', // Pagination != ApiPagination
                'Crud.ApiQueryLog'
            ]
```

All done, seriously.

## 4. Using the new API

Please note that the JsonApiListener documentation contains very detailed
[usage descriptions](http://crud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/listeners/jsonapi.html#response-formats)
and since there **no point in duplicating them** here we will
provide you with just two basic examples to get you going.

> The [Postman collection](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/197398a609a6d233a8c2)
> contains examples of `index`, `view`, `add`, `edit` and `delete`.

**Never forget:**

- ALL requests to your new API MUST use the `application/vnd.api+json` Accept Header
- ALL requests with post data MUST use the `application/vnd.api+json` Content-Type Header

### View action (GET)

For this example we are in the mood for a Mojito so we query 
``http://cake3api.app/cocktails/3`` making sure we are using:

- **HTTP Method** ``GET``
- **Accept Header** ``application/vnd.api+json``

{% asset_img api-request-headers-view.png 'API Request Headers for view action' %}

If things went well your API should return Status Code 200 (Success) with a response body in
JSON API format looking similar to:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "cocktails",
    "id": "3",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Mojito",
      "description": "Rum based",
      "created": "2015-04-11T09:52:01+00:00",
      "modified": null
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/api/cocktails/3"
    }
  }
}
```

### Add action (POST)

To create a new cocktail send a JSON API request to
``http://cake3api.app/cocktails`` making sure you are using:

- **HTTP Method** ``GET``
- **Accept Header** ``application/vnd.api+json``
- **Content-Type Header** ``application/vnd.api+json``

{% asset_img api-request-headers-add.png 'API Request Headers for add action' %}

Also make sure to set the full or partial body data in (absolutely) correct JSON API format, e.g:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "cocktails",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Some cocktail",
      "description": "Some description"
    }
  }
}
```

Now send the request.

If things went well your API should return Status Code 201 (Success) with a response body in
JSON API format looking similar to:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "cocktails",
    "id": "24",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "Some name",
      "description": "None inspired description",
      "created": "2017-03-16T19:01:57+00:00",
      "modified": "2017-03-16T19:01:57+00:00"
    },
    "links": {
      "self": "/api/cocktails/24"
    }
  }
}    
```

## 5. Enabling CORS middleware

Your API will be pretty useless if people (from other domains) won't be able to use it
so let's enable it right now along with CakePHP's
[new middleware functionality](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/controllers/middleware.html)
by following the book's [step-by-step instructions](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/controllers/middleware.html#adding-the-new-http-stack-to-an-existing-application)
:

1. update `webroot/index.php`
2. create `src/Application.php` by copying from the cakephp-app repo

Now that our application is capable of handling middleware let's add the
[cakephp-cors middleware plugin](https://github.com/ozee31/cakephp-cors) by running:

```bash
composer require ozee31/cakephp-cors
```

Enable the plugin by adding this to `config/bootstrap.php`:

```php
Plugin::load('Cors', ['bootstrap' => true, 'routes' => false]);
```

To complete, specify the correct ExceptionRenderers in `config/app.php`
so the JSON API (validation) errors keep functioning as expected whilst
also respecting CORS headers:

```php
    'Error' => [
        'errorLevel' => E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED,
        'exceptionRenderer' => '\CrudJsonApi\Error\JsonApiExceptionRenderer',
        'skipLog' => [],
        'log' => true,
        'trace' => true,
    ],

    'Cors' => [
        'exceptionRenderer' => '\Cors\Error\AppExceptionRenderer'
    ],
```

Please note that the plugin will allow CORS for all origins, all methods and all headers by default
which is a very good thing as we will start using CORS pretty heavily in the next tutorial.

## 6. Make it better

Even though the JsonApiListener is already quite feature-complete, some parts of the JSON API specification 
(like [Sparse Fieldsets](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets) and query parameters) have
not been implemented yet. Feel free to submit a PR for missing functionality and help work towards a
full-featured implementation of the specification, the effort should be minimal.
